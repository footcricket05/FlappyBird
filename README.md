Welcome to my project aimed at explaining reinforcement learning in the simplest way possible! I've trained a tiny 32px by 32px version of Flappy Bird using Q-learning, all within a JavaScript script. Dive in to explore how this classic game can teach us about reinforcement learning!

🧠 **Learning Logic Explained**

The heart of the project lies in `js/brain.js`, where you'll find the learning logic documented extensively. I break down the baseline Q-learning algorithm from scratch and show how it's applied in real-time. Get ready to understand the magic behind the bird's learning process!

🎮 **Play and Learn**

No need for external dependencies or installations! You can train and test the game right inside your browser. Witness the bird's journey as it learns to navigate through the pipes. Check it out [website]() and watch the magic happen! ¯\\(ツ)/¯

🚀 **Fast Learning**

In an ideal scenario, our feathered friend masters the static environment in just 25 trials! But if you're feeling adventurous and want to challenge it with randomized environments, brace yourself—it might take over 1000 trials to conquer. Patience is key!
